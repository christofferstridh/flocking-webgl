# flocking-webgl
a boids application implemented in js/webgl using THREE js (and other stuff) - a work in progress

I did this to learn some: webgl, THREE js, some js toolchain stuff - and because I love bird flocking motions.

It's derived from this (processing js) implementation : http://processingjs.org/learning/topic/flocking/

it's live here:

(it's usually not the latest version though)
